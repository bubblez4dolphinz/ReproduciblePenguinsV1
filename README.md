# ReproduciblePenguinsV1
Hi there. I hope the repo makes sense. 
All you really need to know is that the file called Assessment-ReproducibleFigures is where the main code is and its provided as an Rmarkdown and as a knitted html file.
I have used renv so you can check package/R version status in the renv.lock file and I can provide the whole renv folder if required (but it is too large to upload at once).
There are two function scripts - one for cleaning and one to install/load packages as required. 
I have included the 'figures' and 'data' folders but if they weren't there, the code should have created them anyways.
